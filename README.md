## Tech-Powered Talent Showcase
Welcome to the Tech-Powered Talent Showcase repository! This project aims to protect privacy while amplifying voices through the use of machine learning and computer vision technologies.

## Overview
During an exchange semester in Italy, I encountered a dilemma: capturing the performance of a talented street singer in Florence risked exposing bystanders' identities. Motivated to find a solution, I drew inspiration from my work at the University of Bologna and designed an algorithm using YOLOv8. It intelligently blurs background faces, ensuring only the singer remains clear.

## Features
Privacy Protection: Blur background faces while keeping the main subject clear.
Amplifying Voices: Showcase talent without compromising privacy.
Machine Learning Integration: Utilizes YOLOv8 for intelligent face blurring.
Future Developments
I'm currently exploring the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to further protect bystanders' identities without blurring. Stay tuned for updates!
